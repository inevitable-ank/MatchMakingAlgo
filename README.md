## 📊 Algorithm Components

### 1. Feature Vector Generation
Each profile and user is converted to a normalized feature vector containing:
- **Academic Features**: One-hot encoded university, degree, year
- **Geographic Features**: City and location preferences
- **Personal Features**: Age (normalized), interest categories
- **Content Features**: Bio length, compatibility scores

### 2. Similarity Computation
Multiple similarity metrics are combined:
- **Cosine Similarity**: Feature vector comparison
- **Academic Similarity**: University/degree/year matching
- **Interest Overlap**: Jaccard similarity for interests
- **Geographic Similarity**: City matching
- **Age Compatibility**: Age difference scoring

### 3. UCB Bandit Algorithm
```python
UCB_Score = Exploitation_Score + α × Exploration_Bonus + Similarity_Bonus
```

Where:
- **Exploitation Score**: Historical like ratio for the profile
- **Exploration Bonus**: √(2 × log(total_interactions) / profile_views)
- **Similarity Bonus**: Content-based similarity score

### 4. Progressive Filtering Strategy
The algorithm adapts its strategy based on user interaction count:

| Stage | Random | Diverse | Exploit |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| Early (<10) | 15% | 30% | 55% |
| Mid (10-30) | 10% | 20% | 70% |
| Late (>30) | 5% | 10% | 85% |

## 📋 Trade-off Analysis

### Algorithmic Choices
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combined multi-armed bandit (UCB) learning with content-based filtering and diversity mechanisms for a balance of personalization, explainability, and engagement.
- **Simplicity vs. Complexity:** Chose interpretable, fast algorithms over deep learning for transparency, maintainability, and real-time performance.
- **Diversity vs. Familiarity:** Explicitly balanced recommendations between familiar (similar background) and diverse (different background) profiles to avoid filter bubbles.

### Performance vs. Personalization
- **Real-time Response:** All computations are in-memory and vectorized, ensuring sub-100ms response times.
- **Personalization:** The system adapts to every user interaction, but does not require heavy offline retraining.

### Scalability vs. Richness
- **Scalability:** Designed for 10,000+ users per city using efficient data structures and stateless logic.
- **Richness:** Omitted advanced NLP and collaborative filtering for speed and clarity.

### Other Considerations
- **Fairness:** UCB bandit ensures all profiles have a chance to be shown, preventing "winner-takes-all" effects.
- **Privacy:** Only minimal, necessary user data is used for matching.

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Deployment
- **Microservice Architecture:** Deploy as a stateless REST API (e.g., FastAPI/Flask).
- **Containerization:** Use Docker for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Statelessness:** Store user and profile data in a scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis for caching).

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Performance Monitoring:** Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana to monitor response times and error rates.
- **Engagement Analytics:** Track like ratios, time-to-match, and user retention.
- **Fairness Auditing:** Periodically audit logs to ensure no user/group is systematically disadvantaged.

### Continuous Improvement
- **A/B Testing:** Deploy new algorithm variants to a subset of users and compare engagement/match rates.
- **Feedback Loop:** Use explicit (like/dislike) and implicit (dwell time, skips) feedback to refine the model.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Monitor for cold-start users and adjust exploration/exploitation as needed.

### Scaling
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Run multiple service instances behind a load balancer.
- **Caching:** Use Redis or similar for frequently accessed data.

### Security & Privacy
- **Data Minimization:** Only store/process data required for matching.
- **Access Controls:** Restrict access to sensitive user data.
- **Compliance:** Follow best practices for data protection and privacy.
